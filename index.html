            <h1>Ouarzazate</h1>
            <p>
                Ouarzazate is a city south of Morocco’s High Atlas mountains, known as a gateway to the Sahara Desert.
                Its huge Taourirt Kasbah, home to a 19th-century palace, has views over the rugged local landscape,
                which features in several movies. Northwest is the fortified red-earth city of Aït Ben Haddou. Northeast
                is the rocky Todra Gorge. A road winds southeast through the Draa Valley’s lush palm groves to the
                desert.

                <h1>Chefchaouen</h1>
                <p>
                    Chefchaouen, or Chaouen, is a city in the Rif Mountains of northwest Morocco. It’s known for the striking, blue-washed buildings of its old town. Leather and weaving workshops line its steep cobbled lanes. In the shady main square of Place Outa el Hammam is the red-walled Kasbah, a 15th-century fortress and dungeon, and Chefchouen Ethnographic Museum. The octagonal minaret of the Great Mosque rises nearby.

                    <h1>Casablanca</h1>
                    <p>
                        Casablanca is a port city and commercial hub in western Morocco, fronting the Atlantic Ocean. The city's French colonial legacy is seen in its downtown Mauresque architecture, a blend of Moorish style and European art deco. Standing partly over the water, the enormous Hassan II Mosque, completed in 1993, has a 210m minaret topped with lasers directed toward Mecca.
